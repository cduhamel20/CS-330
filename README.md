When designing software, I focus on understanding the problem, defining clear requirements, and breaking the system into manageable parts. I make sure the design is modular, easy to maintain, and testable. I also work iteratively, refining the design based on feedback. Through projects, Iâ€™ve improved my skills in modular design, using design patterns, and optimizing for performance and security.

In development, I start with planning, prototyping, and breaking the work into smaller tasks. Iteration is key, as I test frequently, gather feedback, and refine the code. Working on 3D scenes taught me to focus on performance with component-based architecture and optimized rendering.

Computer science helps me solve problems and create solutions. Computational graphics improve my understanding of complex data and help me present ideas clearly in both education and my career.
